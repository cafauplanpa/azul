The case studies cover a range of topics, such as marketing, operations, human resources, strategy, ethics, and entrepreneurship. Each case study provides a brief introduction to the organisation and its context, followed by a set of questions that guide the reader to analyse the situation and apply relevant concepts and tools. The case studies are based on real-life scenarios and data, and reflect the diversity and complexity of the South African business environment. The book also includes a useful grid that cross-references business management issues, key concepts, and the relevant case study.
 
Business Cases is a valuable resource for students and instructors of business management, as it helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The book also exposes students to the challenges and opportunities faced by local organisations in a dynamic and competitive market. The book can be used as a supplementary text for Introduction to Business Management or any other introductory business management course. It can also be used as a standalone text for courses or workshops that focus on case study analysis and problem-solving skills.
  
Some of the case studies in the book are:
 
- The dilemmas at NCX Pharmaceuticals, which explores the ethical issues faced by a pharmaceutical company that is accused of price-fixing and collusion.
- Air traffic operations excellence, which examines the operational challenges and solutions of Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS), a state-owned company that provides air traffic management services in South Africa and parts of Africa.
- The beer war in South Africa, which analyses the competitive strategies and tactics of two multinational corporations, SABMiller and Heineken, in the South African beer market.
- Toyota - Purchasing function, which evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the purchasing function of Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM), a leading manufacturer and exporter of vehicles in South Africa.

The book also provides guidelines on how to prepare and present a case study analysis, as well as suggestions for further reading and references. The book is written in a clear and concise style, with relevant examples and diagrams to illustrate the key points. The book is suitable for both self-study and classroom use, as it encourages active learning and critical thinking. Business Cases is an essential companion for anyone who wants to learn more about business management in practice.
